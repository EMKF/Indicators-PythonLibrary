Python library for fetching commonly used publicly available datasets related to entrepreneurship and 
some tools used for visualization and analysis. 


# Installation
In the terminal, type
```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/EMKF/downwardata.git#egg=kcr
```
We are still developing this library, obviously, so local updating will be necessary occasionally. To do this, type
```bash
pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/EMKF/downwardata.git#egg=kcr
```
